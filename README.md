# Duck_in_the_sky_game
Source of my sh*tty game I made for a jam. Made in @GDevelop

## A duck in the sky (but with no diamonds)

Completely drawn and voiced by me.

It´s more of a tech demo than anything else. I was making this game for a "I Can't Draw But Want To Make A Game (Again)" by charlmes on Itch.io - so the extremely low art quality sprites, the messy UI bad color and font usage and the weird sound design were on purpose.

Game time is about 3 minutes, I would say. But if you want to - you can use my sprites, sounds and whatever in your own GDevelop in order to create other levels. 

You can actually play it here: 

There are unused sprites and sounds - originally I thought that this is going to be a short and ugly metroidvania, but it´s actually a short and ugly platformer.
