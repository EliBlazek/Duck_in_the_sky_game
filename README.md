# Duck_in_the_sky_game
Source of my sh*tty game I made for a jam. Made in @GDevelop

## A duck in the sky (but with no diamonds)

Completely drawn and voiced by me.

Bad graphics and estetics is on purpose. Bad gameplay elements and everything else is because I don´t know how to make games. 

Game time is about 3 minutes, I would say. But if you want to - you can use my sprites, sounds and whatever in your own GDevelop in order to create other levels. 

You can actually play it here: https://applep1e.itch.io/duck-game

There are unused sprites and sounds - originally I thought that this is going to be a short and ugly metroidvania, but it´s actually a short and ugly platformer.
